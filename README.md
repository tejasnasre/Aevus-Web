# Aevus - Smart Curriculum Activity & Attendance App

> **Note:** This repository is a showcase/demo of the Aevus project. It is not the actual production application repository.

## Overview

Aevus is an innovative Smart Curriculum Activity & Attendance App designed to revolutionize how educational institutions manage attendance and student productivity. By automating attendance tracking and providing personalized learning guidance during free periods, Aevus enhances both administrative efficiency and student development.

## Problem We Solved

Many educational institutions still depend on manual attendance systems, which are time-consuming and error-prone. Teachers spend a significant portion of class time marking attendance, reducing valuable instructional hours. Additionally, students often waste free periods with unproductive activities due to a lack of structured guidance.

This leads to:
- Poor time management
- Reduced alignment with long-term academic or career goals
- Gap in personalized learning support during idle classroom hours
- Lack of tools that integrate daily schedules with individual student planning and automated tracking
