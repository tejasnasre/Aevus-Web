# Problem Description  
Many educational institutions still rely on manual attendance systems, which are time-consuming and error-prone. Teachers spend a significant portion of class time marking attendance, reducing valuable instructional hours. Additionally, students often waste free periods on unproductive activities due to a lack of structured guidance.  

This leads to poor time management and reduced alignment with long-term academic or career goals. There is also a gap in personalized learning support during idle classroom hours. Institutions currently lack tools that integrate daily schedules with individual student planning and automated tracking.

Providing students with structured personal development activities during free periods can:

- Enhance learning outcomes  

Institutions also gain better insight into student behavior and engagement, enabling more targeted support.
